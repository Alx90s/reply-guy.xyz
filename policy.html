      <h1>Privacy Policy for Twitter Reply Generator</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 8, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Twitter Reply Generator Chrome Extension ("Extension",
        "we", "us", "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
        disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Extension.
        Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the
        terms of this privacy policy, please do not install or use the
        Extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Extension allows users to generate AI-powered replies on Twitter/X,
        customize an AI persona, and utilize an auto-reply feature.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We may collect information about you in a variety of ways when you use
        the Extension:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an account
          via the Extension popup, we collect your email address, chosen
          username, and password. This information is sent securely to our
          backend server (api.reply-guy.xyz) to create and manage your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Authentication Data:</strong> We use HTTP cookies to manage
          your login session between the Extension and our backend server
          (api.reply-guy.xyz). The Extension requests permission to access
          cookies specifically for this purpose. Your authentication token
          itself is not stored locally in browser storage, but your logged-in
          status and basic user info (username, credits) might be.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Data & Content:</strong> To generate replies, the
          Extension's content script identifies the text content of the tweet
          you are replying to on the Twitter/X page. This tweet content is sent
          to our backend server (api.reply-guy.xyz) for processing by the AI
          model. The generated reply text is then sent back to the Extension to
          be inserted into the reply field.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Settings & Persona:</strong> Settings you configure
          within the Extension's options page, such as maximum reply length, AI
          temperature (creativity), your custom persona description, and
          auto-reply preferences (delay times, reload limits), are stored
          locally using Chrome's storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). These
          settings may also be associated with your user ID.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interaction Data:</strong> The Extension's content script
          interacts with the Twitter/X webpage DOM (Document Object Model) to
          identify elements like tweets, reply buttons, text areas, and post
          buttons to enable its functionality. It does not collect personal data
          from these interactions beyond the tweet content needed for reply
          generation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>

          To provide the core functionality of the Extension, including
          generating AI replies based on tweet content and your custom persona.
        </li>
        <li>
          To operate the auto-reply feature according to your configured
          settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          To store your preferences and settings locally for a personalized
          experience.
        </li>

        information under the following circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share tweet content and
          persona settings with our backend service (api.reply-guy.xyz) which
          utilizes AI models to generate replies. These providers are obligated
          to protect your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        authentication status are stored locally on your device using the
        `chrome.storage.local` API. We implement security measures designed to
        protect your information, however, no electronic transmission or storage
        is 100% secure.
      </p>
